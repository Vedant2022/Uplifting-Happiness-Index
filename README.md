Uplifting-Happiness-Index


This is our Team DHANUSH project which we established during Hackathon conducted by Sandip University Nashik.

This project identifies and recognizes human current emotion through facial recognition.

But sometimes facial expressions may be faked but the speech can more accurately predict the emotion of humans.

Moreover we have asked user questions on the basis of CANTRILL LADDER and the formula we have created. 
Using the same formula we calculate the Happiness Index of the user.


Happiness Index ranges as follow:

0-4 -------> User is in very bad phase 

5 and 6 ---> User is in struggling phase
7-10 ------> User is in thriving condition that is he/she is happy


Ater calculating we suggests user some videos that would really help the user to come over the current situation or to improve current situation.


FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT

This is the initial stage or we can say prototype of our Idea. In future we can work on this project more accurately to get actual emotion 
even when user tries to fake the system.
